# Rust Programming Journey

A comprehensive exploration of the Rust programming language following the official Rust book curriculum from Brown University. This repository documents my progression through advanced Rust concepts and demonstrates practical implementation of core programming principles.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into 20 chapters, each focusing on key Rust concepts:

1. Getting Started
2. Programming a Guessing Game
3. Common Programming Concepts
4. Understanding Ownership
5. Structs and Related Data
6. Enums and Pattern Matching
7. Project Management and Modules
8. Common Collections
9. Error Handling
10. Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes
11. Automated Testing
12. I/O Project: CLI Program
13. Functional Programming
14. Cargo and Crates.io
15. Smart Pointers
16. Fearless Concurrency
17. Async/Await
18. Object-Oriented Features
19. Pattern Matching
20. Advanced Features

## Technical Competencies Demonstrated

- Memory safety and ownership concepts
- Concurrent and parallel programming
- Systems programming
- Modern error handling
- Test-driven development
- Performance optimization
- Async programming
- Object-oriented and functional programming paradigms

## Getting Started

Each chapter directory contains working examples and implementations. To run any example:

```bash
cd chapter-XX/section-YY
cargo run
```

## Skills Showcase

This repository demonstrates proficiency in:
